## Mistral 8x7B empowered by RAG ##


Hi there,

I've just completed my first project using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model based on open-source technology. 

RAG enhances a model's ability to maintain long contexts and comprehend complex concepts without requiring specific training. This is achieved by vectorizing data, which stores information as vectors, making it easier for the LLM to retrieve information.

This approach is highly effective in reducing hallucinations and addressing information gaps in large language models.

The main challenge is the computational power required to run such a model. Running it locally is difficult due to the significant power needed for chunk splitting, which involves converting text from documents into vectors. This issue persists: the more powerful the software, the greater the computational demands.
